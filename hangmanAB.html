<hr>
<p>For this project, I had just finished a 4 Hour C++ Course, and wanted to build my first project.</p>
<p>I wanted it to be unique, although quite a bit of trouble developing an idea.</p>
<p>Although at Summer School, two people were playing a game of “Hangman” beside me.</p>
<p>And therefore the idea was born.</p>
<h2 id="heading2">During Development:</h2>
<hr>
<p>Programming this game, had its challenges, the reslits from that and my limited C++ knowledge.</p>
<p>This ended up with crossroads away from the original Hangman’s gameplay.</p>
<p>Those being:</p>
<li>The maximum letters in a single word is 7</li>
<li>The entire word has to lowercase</li>
<li>A word if it contains a letter that appears more than once, this can only happen twice</li>
<p>Thanks to these limitations, that I set very late into development, I was able to make an easy system, that was a lot of comparisons, primarily, that basically, if the letter a user guessed</p>
<p>equals a letter that is one of the inputted from earlier, then add a point or subtract a point if that’s not true.</p>
<p>And I simply added a “and” feature that checked if a letter that is guessed, while equaling what the player guessed, also equals one of the other letters in the word, add two points.</p>
<h2 id="heading2">All-In-All:</h2>
<hr>
<p>I learned a lot from this project.</p>
<p>Sure, it took A LOT of time, and it’s very ugly to look at under the hood,</p>
<p>But I’m still proud of the end project which looks way better.</p>
<p>I was able to flily use the Pomodoro Technique, which allowed me to feel more relaxed while developing this project, knowing the time was something I didn’t need to replisively think about.  </p>
<p>In terms of code, I used things such as:</p>
<li>Primarily If statements, and else statements, alongside comparison operators</li>
<li>A lot of Booleans</li>
<li>Custom functions</li>
<li>Arrays</li>
<p>And Basics such as strings, and ints.</p>
<p>I’m happy I was able to start and stay with a project, no matter how tired I colid sometimes be.</p>
<p>And I plan in the future to remake this project, hopeflily with more knowledge of C++, and a cleaner engine under the hood.</p>
