<p>Wall-E is one of the best animated movies I ever saw, and it’s quite nostalgic. I remember finding an old Wall-E DVD, it was very withered, and apparently textured!</p>
<p>But it reminded me of watching it on an old DVD player. Now, 10+ years later, I watched a video by The Templin Institute about the Buy N Large Corporation, and I was thinking about getting </p>
<p>into a field like web design at this time, so I thought: “Why not make my first project, for “Buy N Large?”</p>
<h2 id="heading2">During Development:</h2>
<hr>
<p>I am aware that an actual Buy N Large website did exist, so I did want to make it somewhat unique. And because this was my first time truly designing a website using recently learned </p>
<p>tools HTML and CSS, I also wanted to keep it simple.  I gave myself roughly a week to practice with deadlines.</p>
<p>I planned out something, whereas, the Homepage would have a special "gimmick” Which resulted in the Buy N Large logo being surrounded by links to the other pages, while concluding with a simple fake contact box.</p>
<p>On the other pages, I got to practice with more image implementation, alongside responsive web design with Flexbox,</p>
<p>in the store page, where if you minimize the screen on the shop page, each item, with wrap so you can still access everything in a nice clean way.</p>
<p>In the Careers tab, I got to practice a bit with borders. Alongside borders, I found out how to use border-radius commands that allowed the borders to resemble a more Buy N Largeish look.</p>
<p>And in the About page, a kind of, combination of everything, Flexbox to make the images move smoothly, giving text, backgrounds, and borders, and finding out ways to make specific letters a different colour, and opacity.</p>
<h2 id="heading2">All-In-All:</h2>
<hr>
<p>Although this was fairly simple & small project, it was 100% beneficial, I primarily gained confidence, in topics such as:</p>
<li>Flexbox</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>Hover Animations</li>
<li>Borders</li>
<p>I also enjoyed making a website on something I’m truly passionate about, and it didn’t hurt that I was using the Pomodoro Technique to not burn myself out.</p>
<p>This is another one I may remake after obtaining more knowledge of both HTML, CSS, and maybe Javascript.</p>
