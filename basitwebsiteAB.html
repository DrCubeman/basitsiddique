<h2 id="heading2">General:</h2>
<hr>
<p>This is something I’m really proud of.
Using knowledge I had gained from my previous Buy N Large Website, I really wanted to build my own website.</p>
<p>I read in several places that you should have your own website, especially in our field of programming and web design. So I set out to do just that.</p>
<h2 id="heading2">During Development:</h2>
<hr>
<p>I usually always plan something with knowledge of my current skill level of what this project is made with, and what themes I like in mind.</p>
<p>Although this was the case here, I still ended up scrapping several early copies of this site, because it didn’t fit me.</p>
<p>What fits me? </p>
<p>Well, I gathered some things and themes, I do like. </p>
<li>The colour Black</li>
<li>Cyberpunk and Sci-Fi aesthetic</li>
<li>Black Minimalism</li>
<li>Simplisty</li>
<p>I took inspiration from some other personal sites, whereas the homescreen had several buttons in the middle, along with their name.</p>
<p>Which I liked, nice, simple and minimalist. A personal spin I added was, well if you go to the homepage, those red lines turning white, that go up down,</p>
<p>well I was actually inspired by a scene in John Wick Chapter 4. (spoilers)</p>
<img src="Screenshot 2025-08-19 172252.png" alt="In John Wick Chapter 4, this is in the Osaka Continental">
<p>In the Osaka Continental, there are a lot of these LED blocks that even resemble an archway, and I thought that the lights used around this hotel were very nice,</p>
<p>and I designed my own version of it, which was a lot more simple, but I ended up really liking it.</p>
<p>For the entire site, I based it off what the final homepage looked like, black, white, and a bit of colour here and there. Something I felt comfortable with and really spoke to my personality a bit.</p>
<p>I used a bunch of skills I had learned during the development of the Buy N Large Website, such as Flexbox (most notability on the “About Me” page, where my favorite movies are, borders,</p>
<p>(like for buttons and also on the about me page, the borders surrounding the titles of the programming languages I know) Animations, such as the those red and white markers, and even played around with the @media feature in CSS,</p>
<p>where basically, if for example, on the homepage if the page squishes a bit, hide the markers, I did this primarily because of the way I made the markers, if they even used Flexbox,</p>
<p>they would off center a bit and not show a couple, so I just decided to hide them entirely, because I wanted to have an equal, or none, either 2 and 2 or 3 or 3.</p>
<h2 id="heading2">All-In-All:</h2>
<hr>
<p>This was more a less taking everything I learned and making a meal with it, and I’m happy with the way my website turned out. I like simple, minimalist black, while having my own little spin on </p>
<p>it. And I got to learn more about CSS, such as the @media function, but also more strategies, </p>
<p>like for example setting the font of an entire document using one function rather than individually doing it, if the entire document is using that one font for example.</p>
